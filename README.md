In the following article I have mentioned how Chat GPT-4 has made Data Mining process much easier, as it almost automates the complete process. 
 
### This repository contains collab notebooks in which different types of datasets are handled and many Data Mining operations are performed - 
Few Notable Operations are as follows-
1. Exploratory Data Analysis.
2. Clustering.
3. Data Modelling.

## Running the notebooks -
1. Open any of the above folders.
2. In each folder there is a file with `.ipynb` extension, this is python notebook, and also the dataset on which the opeartions are performed.
3. You can preview the operations which I performed by opening the python notebook in preview mode, or you can select `Open in Colab` button and it will open my python notebook in google colab.
4. Alternatively, if you wish to execute the code in your own environment, first you need to load the provided dataset and modify the path of the dataset inorder to perform operations on it.
